# titanic-passenger-analysis

Overview:

- This project undertakes the analysis of the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. The Titanic dataset is historically significant, containing data about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. The aim is to use machine learning techniques to identify patterns and factors that influenced the survival of passengers.
- The dataset, "Titanic.csv", includes various features such as passenger class, age, sex, fare, and others.

Prerequisites:

- Python installation is required. If you do not have Python, you can download and install it.
- Jupyter Notebook is also necessary for running the project.

Usage:

- Data Preparation:
     - Ensure your dataset is named "Titanic.csv".
     - Review the dataset columns and structure to understand the data.

- Running the Project:
     - Start Jupyter Notebook.
     - Open the notebook file .ipynb.
     - Run the cells sequentially to proceed through the data analysis, preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.

- Project Structure:
     - titanic_passenger_analysis.ipynb: Contains the code and detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset.
     - Titanic.csv: The dataset with passenger information.
     - requirements.txt: A list of Python packages required to run the notebook.

- Libraries Used:
   - Pandas
   - Numpy
   - Scikit-Learn
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn
